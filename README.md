# algorand-fee-calculator

Sometimes can be hard to calculate how mouch does it cost to send multiple transactions on Algorand Blockchain, especially for assets transfer, like NFTs creation and airdrops.
This app makes it easy to calculate fees and estimate costs before doing that.

Usage: npm start [assetsCount] [receiversCount] [freezeTrueFalse]
